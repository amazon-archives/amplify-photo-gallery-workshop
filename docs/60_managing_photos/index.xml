      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ll need a place to store all of the photos that get uploaded to our albums. Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) is a great option for this and Amplify&amp;rsquo;s Storage module makes setting up and working with S3 very easy.
You can read more about Amplify&amp;rsquo;s Storage module here.
 Configuring and adding storage First, we&amp;rsquo;ll use the Amplify CLI to enable storage for our app. This will create a bucket on Amazon S3 and set it up with appropriate permissions so that users who are logged in to our app can read from and write to it.</description>

      <description>Now that we have an S3 bucket where our photos can get stored, we&amp;rsquo;ll want to create a UI that lets us upload photos to that bucket for storage. We&amp;rsquo;ll also need to track that the photo was intended to be part of a specific album that it was uploaded to, so that we can eventually load all of the photos that belong to that album.
Let&amp;rsquo;s create a new S3ImageUpload component that will contain an HTML file input element which will fire off an event handler when a user selects a photo.</description>
