      <description>Your account must have the ability to create new IAM roles and scope other IAM permissions.
 If you already have an AWS account, and have IAM Administrator access, you can skip this page.
  If you don&amp;rsquo;t already have an AWS account with Administrator access: create one now
 Once you have an AWS account, ensure you are following the remaining workshop steps as an IAM user with administrator access to the AWS account: Create a new IAM user to use for the workshop</description>

      <title>Create a Cloud9 Workspace</title>
      <link>https://awskrug.github.io/amplify-photo-gallery-workshop/10_prerequisites/10_workspace.html</link>

      <description>AWS Cloud9 is a cloud-based integrated development environment (IDE) that lets you write, run, and debug your code with just a browser. It includes a code editor, debugger, and terminal. Cloud9 comes prepackaged with essential tools for popular programming languages, including JavaScript, Python, PHP, and more, so you don&amp;rsquo;t need to install files or configure your development machine to start new projects.
The Cloud9 workspace should be built by an IAM user with Administrator privileges, not the root account user.</description>

      <description>Before we begin coding, there are a few things we need to install, update, and configure in the Cloud9 environment.
Installing and updating In the Cloud9 terminal, run the following commands to install and update some software we&amp;rsquo;ll be using for this workshop:
# Update the AWS CLI pip install --user --upgrade awscli # Install and use Node.js v8.10 (to match AWS Lambda) nvm install v8.10.0 nvm alias default v8.</description>
