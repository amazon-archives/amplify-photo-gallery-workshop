      <description>Our Goal In this workshop, we&amp;rsquo;ll build an app with quite a few features, including:
 Allowing user sign up and authentication, so we know who owns which photo albums
 Building an API server, so our front end has a way to load the appropriate albums and photos to show a given user
 Storing data about albums, photos, and permissions of who can view what, so that our API has a fast and reliable place to query and save data to</description>

      <description>Creating a React app We&amp;rsquo;ll get things started by building a new React web app using the create-react-app CLI tool.
This will give us a sample React app with a local auto-reloading web server and some helpful transpiling support for the browser like letting us use async/await keywords, arrow functions, and more.
 You can learn more about create-react-app at https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app.
 In the Cloud9 terminal, run npx create-react-app photo-albums, then navigate to the newly created directory cd photo-albums</description>
