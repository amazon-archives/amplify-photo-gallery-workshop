      <title>Integrating Amazon Rekognition</title>

      <description>It would be great if we could find images without having to manually tag them with descriptions of their contents. Luckily, adding this feature is pretty easy thanks to Amazon Rekognition. We can use the DetectLabels API &amp;ndash; if we give it a photo, it will respond with a list of appropriate labels for the image. Perfect!
Amazon Rekognition&amp;rsquo;s DetectLabels Quick Summary  You pass the input image as base64-encoded image bytes or as a reference to an image in an Amazon S3 bucket.</description>

      <title>Making Photos Searchable</title>

      <description>Updating the GraphQL Schema Now that we are storing labels for each photo, we&amp;rsquo;re ready to move on and expose this data via our AppSync API.
While it&amp;rsquo;s possible to perform some level of searching via DynamoDB Query operations, a more flexible and performant approach is to use the Amazon Elasticsearch Service to index data and handle our search queries. Fortunately, the Amplify CLI makes creating an Amazon Elasticsearch Service endpoint, and connecting it to our app&amp;rsquo;s data, very easy.</description>

      <title>Searching Photos By Label</title>

      <description>With all of the back-end work completed, now we just need to update our web app to allow searching for photos by label.
Let&amp;rsquo;s create a new Search component and add it to the App component to be rendered on the root path. For rendering all of the matching photos in the Search component, we&amp;rsquo;ll re-use the PhotosList component we already created.
Replace photo-albums/src/App.js with the following: // photo-albums/src/App.js  import React, { Component } from &amp;#39;react&amp;#39;; import {BrowserRouter as Router, Route, NavLink} from &amp;#39;react-router-dom&amp;#39;; import { Divider, Form, Grid, Header, Input, List, Segment } from &amp;#39;semantic-ui-react&amp;#39;; import {v4 as uuid} from &amp;#39;uuid&amp;#39;; import { Connect, S3Image, withAuthenticator } from &amp;#39;aws-amplify-react&amp;#39;; import Amplify, { API, graphqlOperation, Storage } from &amp;#39;aws-amplify&amp;#39;; import aws_exports from &amp;#39;.</description>
